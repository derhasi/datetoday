TODO
----

1) change wording (content type, annotation, plugin) to maybe 'content handler', 'handler', 'connector'
   has to differ from other modules, to avoid confusion, but

2) Access control / visibility settings via API functionality?
3) Adminsitration links (Add-, Edit-, Delete annotation)
4) Build more hooks?
5) 'setings file' info, to include for settings
